based on the works of: https://maker.pro/arduino/projects/how-to-animate-billy-bass-with-bluetooth-audio-source


see the diagnostic tool branch for assistance in setting it up

sadly it doesnt work as intended at this time. I dont know if its the audio detection or the motors need more power to them for this model?
